# CitiBikeData



## ReadMe Summary: Citi Bike Data Analysis

### Project Overview  
This project explores Citi Bike data to provide insights into user behavior and enhance urban mobility in New York City. By analyzing spatial and temporal variables, the study offers recommendations for improving transportation planning and optimizing the bike-sharing system.

### File Explanations

- CitiBikeAnalysis contains the full project intergrated everyone's contributions. 
- CitiBikeMembershipInsights contains some of the starter code used to derive the membership insights, as well as some unused code that primairly contains analysis of New York's CitiBike data.

### Key Data Features  
- **Data Fields**: Start/End Time, Station Name, Bike ID, User Information (Gender, Birth Year), Membership Status.  
- **Integration**: Citi Bike data merged with weather data (temperature, precipitation) for comprehensive analysis.

---

### Main Objectives  
1. **Demographic Insights**  
   - **Gender Trends**: Male riders dominate, taking 3x more rides than females (2016–2020).  
   - **Age Distribution**: Peak usage by riders in their late 20s to early 30s.  
   - **Membership Behavior**: Subscribers take shorter, frequent trips; casual riders favor longer, leisure rides.  

2. **Weather Analysis**  
   - Impact of weather on trip duration and frequency.  
   - Correlation between temperature, precipitation, and ride patterns.  

3. **Usage Patterns**  
   - **Peak Hours**: Evening commute (4–6 PM) sees the highest demand.  
   - **Popular Stations**: Top stations near Union Square, 8th St, and 23rd St.  
   - **Frequent Routes**: Central Park rides dominate the top routes.  

---

### Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Standardized multi-month datasets.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Temporal trends, heatmaps, and route mapping.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Weather data's impact on bike usage.

---

### Findings  
1. **Seasonal Variations**  
   - Higher ridership in spring/summer; decline in winter.  
2. **Operational Recommendations**  
   - Reallocate resources to peak hours and high-demand stations.

---

### Limitations  
- Analysis based on October 2024 data; seasonal variations may not be fully captured.  
- Travel paths between start and end stations remain uncertain.
